# transformer-calculator
This repository contains my implementation of a calculator using Transformers. The implementation is built on top of Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT] with a few changes --- the most major one being that transformer-calculator is an encoder-only model while GPT is a decoder-only model. The idea of this project itself came from the list of exercises associated to the [nanoGPT lecture].
